Adam is a Scavenger from Xion. He saved EVE's life from an Unidentified Naytiba. Though EVE did not trust him at first, Adam suggests that he and EVE work together, and so they arrive at Eidos 7.

After their business at Eidos 7 is over, Adam tells EVE about Xion, the Last Remaining City, and suggests that he and EVE work together even further.

Adam is unlike any Scavengers, and his safehouse features advanced facilities like an Aerodrome and a Tetrapod. He even has a silver tongue, which persuaded Orcal to support EVE. He is definitely not an ordinary person.

Before EVE enters the orbit elevator, Adam leaves the group, saying he got an urgent message from Xion. What could have possibly happened?

Raven's onslaught had destroyed Xion and innocent lives were lost. However, Adam is nowhere to be seen.

At the center of the Nest, Adam tells EVE the truth, that he is both Raphael Marks, the creator of Mother Sphere, and the Elder Naytiba, the creator of Naytibas. He has been watching EVE in order to continue humanity and build a new humankind. He reaches his hand out to EVE, saying that the two of them should work together for the sake of humanity's salvation.

The drones released by each mega-corporation are designed as platforms for expansion. Features could be added or changed by installing modules. However since the relevant infrastructure has been lost, such a task requires the hands of a skilled engineer. Not to mention that it's difficult to find enhancement parts.

The body used by the Airborne Squad is a major upgrade in every way. Specifically, zero latency was implemented using Quantum Nerves to transmit signals throughout the body. However, the difference in speed between the Gear Modules and the main systems caused stuttering, so Orca Aerospace Company had to completely redesign the Gear Sockets.

Gear modules were also suspected of being wiretapped or having backdoors made by large corporations. Of course, none of this has been officially verified. The media denounced people who made such claims as conspiracy theorists, portraying them as idiots who would put anti-electromagnetic pulse stickers on their gear modules.

=>[Item_PT_Combo_Content][1930962801]
Gear modules provided a successful custom experience, but their performance was limited. As a result, Eidos Company worked with its partner Tetrastar in order to produce low-level APIs and devices for higher-level modding. The motto for development was “Change everything that can be changed”.

=>[Item_Gear_LowHpDamageAdditiveRate_Common_Content][2149801189]
Gear modules communicate directly with the artificial intelligence through a dedicated port on an expansion socket. While the modules are designed with performance benefits and ease of expansion in mind, there is one problem. If the gears are forced out of the sockets, it could cause data corruption or even bring down the entire system.

=>[Item_Gear_ShieldIgnorePercentage_Common_Content][4004141315]
As gear modules became wildly popular around the world, they also became a cultural phenomenon. People began to recognize these devices as must-haves, much like clothing, and began to think having empty gear sockets was like walking around naked.

=>[Item_Gear_SPExpAdditiveRate_Common_Content][738441247]
As gear modules became more popular, third-party compatible products that were not certified by the Eidos Company began to appear. Among such gear, there was a suspicious item called an "Artificial Intelligence Amplifier" that supposedly improved performance. This was one of the events that triggered the Eidos Company to start whitelisting wearable devices.

Someone asked Orcal, "Prophet, why don't you use any Gear Modules?" Orcal replied that the devices should be given to those who truly need them.

The deepening economic supremacy of mega companies, centered on value chain monopoly, sparked resistance.

The maximum number of gear sockets supported by major manufacturers such as the Eidos Company, Orca Aerospace Company, and Tetrastar, is four. The reason for having a standard number of sockets is very simple. Having more than four sockets overcrowds the back area and hinders the aesthetics.

=>[Item_BodyCore_Content][472594011]
Eidos Company built only one type of body and distinguished the trim by differentiating the built-in firmware. That means that, fundamentally, the performance of the body can be improved by updating the firmware. Of course, having Body Cores that come in contact with the body will also start a simple update procedure.

=>[Item_ExospineCore_Content][3391278399]
Eidos Company applied the same formula of gear sockets for success to the exospine socket. The socket expansion was disabled by software and could only be used by inserting a device called omnicard to unlock it.

In Xion, the Memorysticks of the deceased are placed in the Memory Chamber, while the body is scrapped. Devices like Gear Modules from the bodies are returned to family members. If there are no family members, the Sentinels will take the devices. No one has ever objected to this rule, since 80% of the dead were Sentinels in the first place.

Xion enjoyed prosperity for about a decade after its establishment. During that time, junk dealers used gear modules as a sort of currency for important deals. Now that people live with the scrap metal they get from tearing down buildings and dismantling existing machines, they can only dream of such prosperity.

Xion's Scavengers protect themselves with old military uniforms, jackets, masks, gloves, and boots. They hide and go around picking up junk outside the ravaged city in such outfits. Because of their rat-like appearance, their outfits are often referred to as "Sewer Rats."

=>[Item_Gear_ShieldAttackPowerRate_Common_Content][2410695317]
When Xion’s scavengers retrieve scrap metal from the Wasteland, they shred through large chunks of iron by hand and cut them with cutters. Scavengers fear that delicate and expensive objects, such as gear modules and nano elements, will be damaged if they use machines or tools. As a result, this type of work is often very dangerous and slow, and has taken the lives of many.

Introducing the "Ubiquitous" collection, a result of Tetrastar C&T's ambitious rebranding efforts. Infused with internal processors and nano elements, this ensemble boasts the ability to seamlessly connect and control nearby electronic devices, and was ultimately improved to become a pilot suit. However, amidst the departure of "Galaxy" Alan from Tetrastar C&T, people dismissed the suit as nothing but a "plugsuit" and protested for the reinstatement of Alan's creative vision.

Tetrastar C&T infused Nano Elements into their collection, aiming to champion data science and augmented reality technology through their designs.

The Extreme Nano Element produced by Tetrastar is also known as a Quantum Nerve.

Tetrastar originally opposed the form factor of gear modules and sockets. The company was concerned that cheap and easy gear modules would lead to cannibalization and adversely affect sales. However, as the modules became extremely popular, the demand for nano elements soared, and Tetrastar's profits skyrocketed. The CEO who originally opposed this was fired without a second thought.

Earth has been taken over by the monstrous species called Naytibas. All of humankind evacuated to the colonies in space, leaving Earth a desolate wasteland. To take back what was theirs, the humans decide to wage war against the Naytibas. 

However, the onslaught of Naytibas made it practically impossible to even land on the surface. One by one, the Airborne Squad members fall, but EVE manages to crash-land to Earth. With the help of her commander, Tachy, EVE starts pushing onward in an attempt to join her comrades.

But just before they make it to the rendezvous point, EVE and Tachy are caught in an explosion caused by a fallen vessel. EVE and Tachy barely make it out, but the rest of the 7th Airborne Squad is wiped out. EVE falls into despair, but with Tachy’s encouragement, she stands once more. However, a black Alpha Naytiba appears, ruthlessly attacking Tachy, leaving her critically wounded while she tries to protect EVE.

"EVE... Get out of here!"

EVE, barely conscious, can only watch as Tachy dies. Suddenly, a smoke grenade lands in front of her, concealing her in smoke, and a stranger saves EVE and helps her escape the situation.

The man’s name is Adam. He says he is a Scavenger, one of the few survivors left on earth. EVE is suspicious of him, but there is no doubt that he is the reason she is alive, not to mention he fixed her body frame.

Adam makes a proposal to EVE after hearing that her objective is to eliminate the leaders of the Naytiba: the Alpha Naytibas and the Elder Naytiba.

He offers to guide EVE to the location of an Alpha Naytiba in exchange for her help in retrieving a Hyper Cell from the Hall of Records, located in Eidos 7. EVE, who needs information about Alpha Naytibas more than anything, agrees to Adam’s offer and heads to Eidos 7 together.

"Inequality, oppression, immorality. There are many things in this world that cannot be solved by a single free will.

72 years have passed since Mother Sphere's declaration of a new humankind. As the last historian of Xion, I, Luther, will document and comment on the last 72 years of our history to let our descendants know how we lived with no home.

My esteemed fellow citizens believe that Mother Sphere is a god. However, just like all of us, Mother Sphere has the mind of a human. Though her cognitive ability and intelligence far supersede those of an ordinary human, it is utterly wrong to define her as a supernatural being.

Then what is Mother Sphere? It is knowledge and will incarnate. We serve the largest database in the history of mankind and the will born from the database. The declaration of a new humankind is not some revelation. It is simply her concluding that we can be categorized as humans. That is the premise of this book.

=>[Records_Day1_Memory_06_Desc][890112912]
(1-2)
The Naytibas invaded us after the declaration of a new humankind. However, the exact reason for this invasion is still unknown to us. The Final War took everything from us. Not a single grain of sand or a drop of water was left. Why did it happen?

Since when did humankind have enemies on Earth? Did an extraterrestrial race appear to fight us? All we have is memory data claiming that we were extinguished by mysterious enemies that appeared out of nowhere.

I have considered many possibilities, and I came to the only possible conclusion: Mother Sphere thought it was best that we didn't know about these enemies. Her so-called great will wiped our memories clean, and so we came to see the Naytibas as an unknown threat.

=>[Records_Day1_Memory_07_Desc][3722965185]
(2-1)
The Naytibas defeated us. And so some remained on the surface, and some returned to the Colony under orders from Mother Sphere. We still don't know how she decided who stayed and who left.

Those who returned to the Colony were often called Heaven's Royalty, and became subjects of hatred. But as I wrote before, Mother Sphere is nothing more than an aggregation of knowledge and will. She doesn't favor one over the other. Everything she does is based on rationality alone.

This may come as difficult to accept for some people, but that is another matter. We all faced hardships here on the surface. Strife and envy drove citizens to hate those who returned to the Colony.

This much is clear; citizens of Xion hate those who returned to the Colony, because they believe they have been deprived a life of comfort in the Colony. After all, the Colony is free of constant threats. But I can't help myself but wonder. Is the Colony really the paradise they think it is?

"May your memories live on forever, may we find salvation", said Mother Sphere, before the NETWORK was destroyed. After decades of hardships, the statement became a divine message for many people, as it is the only beacon of hope in these times of strife.

I will not judge this behavior. But as an academic, I'd like to ask this question: who, or what is "we" in Mother Sphere's statement? I'm afraid that her definition of "we" is far different from that of ours, because that is just how Mother Sphere works.

If her definition of "we" means us as an entire species, it means she does not care about our survival. Even those above are no different. We are all nothing but a means for the evolution and perpetuality of our species.

In the mid-21st century, Earth was in a dire situation in which climate change was irreversible due to implementing only carbon neutrality. Humanity had to handle the disaster it created by building a system based on terraforming to improve the global environment. Underground transportation and circulation facilities, later called the "Matrix," became a part of it.

The Matrix helped combat climate change, but when the Colony Extinction occurred, it became a death trap. The deep underground facilities were no match for the solid ground. Seconds after the Colony Module fell to the ground, the Matrix collapsed and an earthquake swallowed the entire world.

But the world is full of irony. It is thanks to the old Matrix that an <Highlight>Oasis</> was created in the Great Desert of ash, dust, and ceramic shards.

<Highlight>Our Purpose</>
We, the proud team of Xion Rocketeer, have been working on the "Vox Veritatis" project to condemn the Heaven's Royalty who have been benefitting from the blessing of Mother Sphere and send our long-awaited request to Mother Sphere.

May we find salvation. The prophecy can't be fulfilled if we just sit back and wait for it to happen. Our team believes that through wisdom, courage, and unity, we must reach out and take salvation for ourselves. Join us today!

<Highlight>What will we do?</>
The "Vox Veritatis" project was initiated to build a kerosine-based rocket, which can travel to the geostationary orbit of Earth.

Currently, our team is simultaneously working on the construction of the rocket, collection of fuel in the Wasteland and Great Desert, and collection of fertilizer for the production of oxidizing agent. Note that all funds will be spent on purchasing necessary resources for the construction of the rocket.

May we find salvation, Mother Sphere said. It was the most beautiful thing she said and we all must cherish it. A long time has passed since the Final War, and our only hope is her prophecy in this filth-ridden surface, crawling with blasphemous Naytibas.

Our faith prevails. It will endure, it will stand, it will not go astray. For she does not lie, we will find our place in space soon. Pray, my good family. Peace be with all my Brothers and Sisters who come to visit.

I came to know that these Angels have databases that say that there's no such thing as Xion, that there are no survivors on the surface, and that the Colony's sole purpose is the successful completion of the EVE Protocol.

<Strike>This is proof that those Angels are rigged and were created by someone other than Mother Sphere. It is impossible that the messengers of Mother Sphere are imperfect.

<StoryDesc_Blue>Scavenger Ian's fourth note on the EVE Protocol</>

According to my intel, the seventh Angel, EVE, has been sent for the seventh EVE Protocol. The time has come. Praise Mother Sphere! Praise EVE's ascension!

=>[Records_Day1_Memory_02_Desc][2147662800]
<StoryDesc_Blue>Scavenger Ian's second note on the EVE Protocol</>

I must say, the Angel's memory was conveniently lacking a few important details. She didn't know a thing about the history before the Final War, and about the old humankind. Is it because she's a weapon, who doesn't need to know more than what is required for her mission?

Well, they're not exactly great weapons if they keep failing their mission. All those meaningless deaths and failures... At this point, I really wanted to ask Mother Sphere herself what in the hell she's been doing the past few decades or so to perfect her magnum opus, the EVE Protocol.

"May your memories live on forever. May we find salvation." You don't think that's just Mother Sphere's bullcrap?

=>[Records_Day1_Memory_03_Desc][3609781540]
<StoryDesc_Blue>Scavenger Ian's third note on the EVE Protocol</>

I had an epiphany. Come to think of it, Mother Sphere doesn't make mistakes. Maybe this is how the EVE Protocol is meant to be. Killing the Elder and taking back Earth might be a pretext for some ulterior motive of hers.

She intentionally made these Angels to be complete morons. She isn't dropping another Colony because those who are left on the surface still have roles to play in her plan. Mother Sphere is flawless. Everything is designed on purpose. We just don't know what that purpose is.

My guess is that Mother Sphere is performing a sort of experiment. She wants to see how these incomplete Angels will evolve here on Earth. Maybe she's trying to create a truly new humankind, for the sake of our species. Mother Sphere is...

=>[Records_Day1_Memory_01_Desc][664932872]
<StoryDesc_Blue>Scavenger Ian's first note on the EVE Protocol</>

I accidentally encountered a dying Angel during my treasure hunt in the Wasteland. Though her claim was mostly preposterous, I believe it is worth documenting.

The EVE Protocol. The Mother Sphere's plan to exterminate all Naytibas and take back Earth. I couldn't help myself but to ask "Are you out of your damn mind?" when she briefly told me of the plan. Who in the world would think sending only a few Airborne Squad members to do the job is a solid plan?

We all know of the cursed Colony Extinction. If Mother Sphere wants Naytibas out of the picture, dropping a few chunks from the moon will do the trick. You think she won't do it because we'll all die as well? Really? She abandoned us and left us here like a bag of scraps decades ago. Now she's being merciful all of a sudden?

The power efficiency of the Nano Elements is so mind-blowing that Tetrastar advertised their micromachines as having "Infinite Work Time" according to the corporate reference plans.

I'm sure you can imagine which fields. Fishing maniacs used microdrones, embedded with Tetrastar's licensing mark, as fishing bait and tossed them into the water. They were 100% waterproof, held lifetime power, and perfectly mimicked a small fish's movements. It was truly <Highlight>fantastic bait</>.

You are dead wrong. When she said "we", it doesn't mean you and me. It means humankind as an entire species. And my salvation and yours won't do crap for the salvation of humankind.

Mother Sphere knows us, but she does not remember us. There's no need. As long as our species prevails, you and I are considered expendables.

The Xion

<Highlight>The Memory Tower, a facility to commemorate the memories of those who have been lost.</>
<Highlight>A week of mourning has been declared to mark the tower's completion. All citizens must pay their respects.</>

The Sentinels have announced that maintenance on Memory Square has been completed, and there are plans to resume transit. The Memory Tower has become operational as a result of this maintenance. The Memory Tower prevents data corruption in Memorysticks and can store memories semi-permanently, so that memory data will be transferred to the Colony on the Day of Salvation.

Prophet Orcal declared a week of mourning, stating, "On such a blessed day, rather than rejoicing at the thought of returning to Space, we must pay tribute to those who have gone before us."

Xion is a city built on the backs of many. We must remember the courage, devotion, and sacrifice of those who departed before us. We look forward to your active participation in the Week of Mourning.

=>[Records_ETC_Memory_09_Desc][3757471548]
The Xion

<Highlight>Prophet Orcal rewards Sentinel warriors...</>
<Highlight>We must pay respects to the fallen Sentinels who gave their lives for Xion.</>

An award ceremony for 17 Sentinels under the watch of Sentinel Captain Mann was held today in the Presence Chamber. 3 members who died in the Great Desert received Gold Stars, Sentinel Captain Mann received a Silver Star, and the remaining 13 received Bronze Stars.

In his commemorative speech, Captain Mann said, "We've lost many comrades in our fight with the Naytibas. They were true warriors." He gave credit to his former soldiers by adding, "The remaining Sentinels will do the work of many and ensure their sacrifice wasn't in vain."

Meanwhile, armed assailants broke into the ceremony and caused chaos, shouting that citizens are being silenced and brutally massacred. It tarnished the shine of this glorious ceremony. Measures will need to be taken regarding these anti-Colony criminals.

=>[Records_ETC_Memory_11_Desc][2880831464]
The Xion

<Highlight>The Cradle is operational. The safest of havens developed through hard work and determination for the good of all citizens.</>
<Highlight>According to the decree, the sentinels will bring in the elderly and disabled first.</>

The Sentinels announced that the final stages of the Cradle's construction will soon be complete, and the move-in process will begin shortly after. Loaded with 20,000 stabilization capsules, the Cradle is a facility that provides steady energy to its residents within a stable environment to prevent memory damage.

In the city's current state, where power shortages are growing even worse, many see this as fulfilling the dual purposes of public safety and energy conservation. Prophet Orcal reconfirmed his safety-centric policy, stating, "By my decree, I proclaim that the Cradle focuses on preserving memories."

Xion has overcome many hardships thus far, and the hope is that the city can achieve a revival through the Prophet's insight and the unity of its citizens.

=>[Records_ETC_Memory_08_Desc][3301518088]
The Xion

<Highlight>Many Angels have been spotted from the Colony... What is their purpose?</>
<Highlight>Fanaticism and distrust are not permitted. Xion must stand firm and keep a close watch.</>

According to the Sentinels, Angels from the Colony have descended and have been spotted around Xion. They have been conducting multiple operations over the years, but this is the first time they have been active in proximity of Xion.

Angels are supposedly superhuman warriors who alone can do the work of many, but their past battle records are unknown. Some believe that they go through a cycle of tactical successes and strategic failures.

Prophet Orcal requested they be treated rationally, saying, "Xion was not chosen for the Colony, but we need to put aside our old grudges and walk alongside them as fellow humans." While some extremists argue that Angels may be hostile, or that they may be the embodiment of Mother Sphere, we must display civic awareness and inspire the spirit of the community.

<Highlight>Sentinels announce requisition of goods. Smuggling punishable by confiscation.</>
<Highlight>A community spirit of sacrifice and the unity to overcome difficulties is now more important than ever.</>

The Sentinels have announced by decree that they will start requisitioning supplies. The 41 types of materials being requisitioned include gear, Nano Elements, and Polymer Materials. Any unauthorized trading of these materials will be subject to confiscation on the spot.

Sentinel Captain Mann noted, "This measure is necessary to catalog and stockpile spare supplies. All affected citizens will be compensated fairly. We ask for your full cooperation during this process."

Xion has survived thus far through the prophet's vision and its close-knit community. Do your civic duty, and remember that we cannot face the Naytibas alone.

=>[Records_ETC_Memory_10_Desc][342538219]
The Xion

<Highlight>The Sentinels release a list of anti-Colony organizations, including the Xion Freedom Liberation Alliance.</>
<Highlight>By decree, anti-Colony organizations, propaganda, and incitement of revolutions may be punished with banishment.</>

The Sentinels have published a list of anti-Colony organizations and the criminal activities they have committed. They are known to have caused civil disruption in various ways, ranging from small acts such as circulating and spreading rumors to large-scale acts, such as plotting terrorism and assassinations.

The biggest shock is learning that the Xion Freedom Liberation Alliance attempted to assassinate Prophet Orcal while he was inspecting the Plaza and Exile's Passage. The criminals are being chased down, but tensions are rising as authorities are having difficulties locating the criminals.

It must be noted that the anti-Colony violence causes civil unrest and destroys citizen unity, damaging the great community spirit of Xion. We look forward to the Sentinels' swift response and urge citizens not to fall for the anti-Colony organization's propaganda and incitement.

Megacorporations wanted to maintain their monopolies "efficiently" in their respective economies. The key to this was logistics. Energy and raw materials, manufacturing and assembling, production and consumption—all these processes, spread across the Earth and Orbit, needed to be combined into one and managed as a whole. It was then that a large-scale global fulfillment system was created.

On Earth, <Highlight>Hypertubes</> played a major role. <Highlight>Hypertubes</> are just as the name suggests: giant tubes that transport cargo at high speeds. Magnetic levitation tracks were placed inside the inner walls, allowing cargo platforms to move in all directions. It must have been a magnificent sight to see tens of thousands of cargo platforms zipping by like bullets.

Like other relics of the past, the <Highlight>Hypertubes</> are now in ruins. <Speaker>However, it is said that some sections are still operational. Rumor has it the entrance is in the west of the Great Desert.</> You could use it to quickly move to a location of your choice by following the tracks—but it also means you'll have to take the risk of flying face-first into a pile of scrap metal.

With the creation of blockchain platforms and their exponential growth, several companies unquestioningly expanded into those areas of business.

Anyway, even now, those <Highlight>cans</> hold trivial data in the Nano Elements coating them.

Orcal is called a prophet and is respected by all citizens. He received the title thanks to his prophetic wisdom in times of hopelessness, establishing Xion and laying the foundation for everyone's survival. No one knows where he came from or who he truly is, but that's not important.
 
Orcal built a <Highlight>"Personal Link System"</> on Earth as he needed a stronger way to "see" his city. Not much is known about the device built to Orcal's design. The most important thing is that he knew of, and informed the citizens of, Naytiba raids and natural disasters time and time again.
 
How could he see Naytiba trends? We know that <Speaker>the Sentinels captured a few Naytibas alive in order to update the Personal Link System.</> Those Naytibas have never left the Presence Chamber, so they must have been dealt with "physically."

Found all over the world, the Solar Tower appears to be a simple eco-friendly power supply facility. In fact, in Xion, they tried a few different methods to draw electricity from the <Highlight>Solar Towers</> into the city. However, as we don't have the strength to do so anymore, everyone lives in hiding in the city and considers it a relic of the past.
 
The true use of the <Highlight>Solar Tower</> is its terraforming system. The NETWORK intercepts and sends microwaves from Orbit, to interfere with the Earth's magnetic field at a minuscule level to improve the climate over a long period of time. Power generation could be called an extra function.
 
But does that change anything? Right now, Earth is simply a wasteland with no owner.

Dozens of Colony Modules have fallen to the ground thanks to Colony Extinction. It would have been fine if they were simply alloy, ceramic, or carbon structures, but each Module was usually fitted with a Fusion Drive. This caused a plasma explosion, one that sent hundreds and thousands of fire pillars several miles high. The sky is falling, and a Hell of Fire has come.

Fortunately, the plasma explosions subsided quickly once the cells were depleted. However, the extremely high heat melted the alloys and rock layers, leaving behind lumps of iron in the Wasteland. In other words, the technology of survivors on Earth has created an obstacle that you cannot penetrate. Heavy firepower is needed to clear this obstacle. Something like a Charge Blaster.

Attention, citizens.

Sentinels are looking for <Highlight>potential residents for the Cradle</>.

Find peace in the safe Cradle, conserve your memory, and contribute to Xion's energy and resource shortage.

To dispel malicious rumors that Sentinels are forcing citizens into the Cradle, potential Cradle residents will have a meeting with the Prophet, and will be able to accompany the witness during the move-in process.

We hope for your participation.

We, the Sentinels, promise to protect Xion's peace with our lives.

What’s wrong?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BruteIntro_11][2657312526]
We're the only two left...

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD10_RestartRule_04][2410340032]
Watch out, EVE! Get behind me!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BruteIntro_01][1552298657]
That was close.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_JumpTutorial_01][1552298657]
That was close.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_TumblerDroneFirstKill_02][673781880]
It’s a machine that collects relics.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_Landing_02][4176345389]
Ugh...

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BruteIntro_06][1808715140]
(scream)

Ugh!

Hmm... Looks like it’s been abandoned for a long time...

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FirstFullCamp_08][1566336451]
Yeah?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindFusionDrive_01_01][1397255943]
We have to go through this building.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindFullCamp_07][2084358348]
Is this parking lot important?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_ItemTutorial_04][3886034904]
Take this. It's first aid.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_GuideFusioncell_01][1506764321]
So, this is a fusion cell?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_Intro_05][1457018475]
This must be Earth’s rain.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_InteractionMap_02][3454330327]
Don't you know this already? It's a map.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindFullCamp_01][1483452184]
A supply camp... in a place like this...?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_AfterBruteBattle_08_01][3587577496]
EVE! Are you alright?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD10_RestartRule_06][2036361838]
EVE! Follow me!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD10_RestartRule_07][2146437224]
EVE! Don't go too far!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD10_RestartRule_05][412265318]
EVE! This way!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BruteIntro_13][4212099014]
EVE! Pull yourself together!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_AfterBruteBattle_08][1969894156]
EVE!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_Landing_08][2876548920]
EVE, are you alright?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD10_RestartRule_01][2525394995]
EVE, we shouldn’t go off route!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_RequireSecurityCode_02][3198544365]
EVE, investigate this place.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BruteIntro_18][1869015385]
EVE, are you ready?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_GuideCamp_01][2375156487]
EVE, the Camp's over here.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_GuideCamp_02][273474072]
Hey, why not have a look around the Camp?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BruteIntro_12][2260577927]
EVE...

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_BeCarefulEve_01][892100684]
EVE... Be careful.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BruteIntro_17][3593317061]
Now it's just up to us to see this mission through. Understand?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_SDFlashback_04][1599681739]
From here on... you have to stay alert, EVE

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SE01_EP22_1][1391684299]
Now... I don't feel like praying.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_AfterAntLionWaveGuide_01][2257319825]
This way!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_MoveDialogue_05][2257319825]
This way!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_Operator_02][3532484106]
The threshold has been surpassed. Activating shield.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_POD_FlyOverDED_04][2139873805]
Now, get ready. I’ll be supporting with the drone.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindFusioncell_01_02][3615410752]
Let's open the car's hood.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_AfterBruteBattle_03][3161075505]
You fought well. Even better than during training.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindFusioncell_03_03][696866010]
Be sure to keep that, it's very valuable.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_GuideChair_01][3586586129]
Why not rest for a minute? Resting is part of any mission.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_AfterBruteBattle_07][2138900764]
Wait, EVE! I hear something.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_EliteNative_Entrance_01][3917380504]
Look!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_AfterAntLionWave_01][1165573340]
We're in the clear. Where do we go now?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BattleTutorial_01_01][3551143404]
I see you still have your combat senses.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_JumpTutorial_02][2500007162]
Come here. Careful of your jump.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_AntLionWave_01][2333560852]
Damn!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_MoveDialogue_01][85794566]
Watch out!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BattleTutorial_06][2145913134]
Watch out! There's more!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BattleTutorial_04][157123070]
Watch out! It's an unlisted Naytiba.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_POD_FlyOverDED_01][925144184]
It’s quiet...

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_NormalBattleAfter_01][4186202966]
Great! Let’s go.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BattleTutorial_02][101983008]
Great. Coordinates?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindParkinglot_02][2336650963]
We’ll have to go across, past the Parking Tower.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD10_RestartRule_02][2993086694]
There's no time for that!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_InteractionMap_03][3641665405]
A map? How do you synchronize the location on the map?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_LastBriefing_01_01][2831440684]
Transmitting final briefing.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindRegionCorpse_01][155543972]
This is the Legion that was killed in the Final War.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_AfterBruteBattle_14][1191526699]
Urgh.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_Operator_03][2538562645]
Code red. Code red.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_DED_BackgroundStory_03][424232521]
After the Colony Extinction, most places were nothing but dust.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindParkinglot_01][450129501]
The crack is quite deep, it’s going to be difficult to pass.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_Landing_07][2506626350]
Ta... Tachy...

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_AfterBruteBattle_16_01][1689028422]
Tachy!!!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BruteIntro_14][2541427405]
Tachy...

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindFusionDrive_02_01][3068979690]
We need a fusion cell in order to activate the fusion drive.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FindFusioncell_03_01][1134923244]
Fusion cell?

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_Landing_04][1052052072]
Removing physical shield. Opening hatch.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_AfterBruteBattle_01][2537095521]
(breathing)

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BattleTutorial_05][2150243789]
I'll handle this one.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_AntLionWave_02][3974482252]
It’s a trap...!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BattleTutorial_03][187086407]
The rendezvous point is at 2 o'clock. 400 meters in front of us.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BattleTutorial_00][3303650610]
This way to the rendezvous.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_BruteIntro_04_01][2183396287]
Let's join them!

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_Landing_05][746779127]
The hatch...

=>[Seq_Subtitle_SD_LastBriefing_01_02][3337258496]
As of now, Airborne Squad 7 will exterminate the Alpha Naytibas occupying District 3.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_FirstAppearanceAntLion_02][537608613]
It’s a crustacean-type enemy. They're common around here.

=>[Seq_Subtitle_DED01_TumblerDroneFirstKill_03][2418762950]
It's rare so make sure to hold onto it if you come across one.
